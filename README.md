# Weather-Dashboard

## ABOUT

I wanted to build a weather dashboard that would run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS using the OpenWeather One Call API to retrieve weather data for cities.

## Usage

WHEN I search for a city THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history. 

WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. 

WHEN I view the UV index THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. 

WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity. 

WHEN I click on a city in the search history THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city.

If I want to clear the list of searched cities, a "clear" button is provided under the list.
